# Google-Maps-Unet
This repository contains code and resources for training and using a UNet-based deep learning model for semantic segmentation on Google Maps images. The model can be used to classify different objects and regions in satellite imagery obtained from Google Maps.

## Overview
The UNet architecture is a popular and effective approach for image segmentation tasks. It consists of an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder captures the spatial information and the decoder generates a segmentation map. The model has been trained on a large dataset of labeled Google Maps images to perform semantic segmentation.

## Installation
To use this code, you will need the following dependencies:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
TensorFlow (version 2.0 or higher)
Keras (version 2.3.1 or higher)
NumPy
Matplotlib
OpenCV
